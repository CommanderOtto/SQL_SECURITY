1. DML_ACTION_AUDITING.sql: 
This script is an example of how to set up a basic auditing procedure for your database tables. This sample represents a DML Action Auditing process (DML = Data Manipulation Language), which will allow a DBA to track all changes (insert, update, delete) made to a specific table. This process will also track the user who performed those actions on the table.

Credit goes to Xiao Luo, for showing me how to do this.
